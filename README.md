Zambretti calculation has been modified for use in the southern hemisphere.

To create this project you will need a BME280 sensor, a real time clock and an arduino nano.

The amount of forcasts is limited by the display which is also directly tied to the memory limitations of the arduino. I tried using a larger display but ran out of memory to implement it.
I will eventually rework the program to work with an ESP 32 and a web based app.
